# Who is Melyanna?

<img src="/img/fluffy_avatar.jpg" alt="Picture of a cat in front of a pc" align="left" style="PADDING-RIGHT: 10px" /> I am an old cat lady who spends way too much time daydreaming.

I work in the video games industry and enjoy my job very much.

When I am not working, I spend my time playing videogames, table-top games (mostly RPGs, but board games too), reading all sorts of genres, and creating mediocre art.

My all time favourite films and TV series are: Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek, Firefly, Barry Lyndon and Blade Runner.

I am vegetarian and my favourite foods are pizza (how original) and French fries.

I drink way too much tea and my kettle is my best friend.

I live with my partner Rodolfo (aka: Gnagnulo) and five rescued cats: Penelope, Sgorgo, Polifemo, Psycho and Fluffy.
