I am planning an update to this blog's "backend" - so to speak. I will definitely keep Dean's amazing theme [Beautiful Jekyll](http://deanattali.com/beautiful-jekyll/), but I am getting tired of the changes I made to the stylesheet and the theme itself has undergone many updates since when I installed it - the last one doing somethig I had already done, but much better.

I am also considering the option of building the blog locally, though I enjoy how easy it is to update the blog now that it's build by GitHub Pages automatically.

The blog might look a bit weird in the next few days and over the weekend, but it's really easy to restore old posts, so I expect it to be back up fairly quickly.
(Unless I just jinxed it, that is...)

Being stuck at home with the flu was unexpectedly productive!

I did update this blog's backend, and it took me much less time than I expected. Everything went smoothly, and I finished in less than 30 minutes.
If everything looks the same as before, it's because updating was so smooth it wasn't worth trying to change anything.

I also practiced Spanish and German using [Duolingo](https://en.duolingo.com/).
Studying two languages at the same time might sound too much, but I already know German, I just need to refresh my memory. And Spanish is quite similar to Italian, so it's easier to learn the vocabulary.

When I wasn't studying foreign languages, I spent time reading [Crash Override](https://zoequinn.squarespace.com/) (anybody in tech should read it) and playing ["Life is Strange. Before the storm"](https://www.lifeisstrange.com), which is really sad, except for the part in which you get to play a table-top game inside the video-game.

I dipped my toes in [Twee2](https://dan-q.github.io/twee2/) and now that I figured it out I can see why it could be better than the [Twine GUI](). I also spent some time learning more about [elementaryOS](https://elementary.io) and Ubuntu.

What I didn't do, is practice Python. I regret it, but I couldn't get myself to do it. I did have a sore throat and high temperature, so I kind of feel excused.

I am going back to work tomorrow and it's D&D night, so I guess my productivity is going to suffer. I'll try to wake up early during the weekend and not spend most of my time on the couch doing nothing in particular.
