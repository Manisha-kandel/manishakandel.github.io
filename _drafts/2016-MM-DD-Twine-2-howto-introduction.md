Twine is a tool to create interactive fiction.
The tool is built on JS and its flexibility allows authors to create a wide range of products, from linear interactive fiction to fully fledged games. It works really well for prototipying too.
Twine is very easy to use and has a gentle learning curve, making development accessible and allowing writers of IF to focus on their stories, while the system takes care of the backend.
Stories can be saved as html files and played in a browser, and so it is very easy
